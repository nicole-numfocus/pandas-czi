# Budget

pandas has requested funding for $250,000. This will fund software development.

For ease of reference, we've expressed the work items in terms of FTEs
(full-time equivalents) assuming that one FTE costs roughly $100,000. Our
indirect costs would be 10% or $25,000, for our fiscal sponsor, NumFOCUS.

Work Item                | Amount
------------------------ | ------
Maintenance- 1.25 FTE    | $125,000
Nullable Types- 1 FTE    | $100,000
Total Direct Costs       | $225,000
Indirect Costs 10%       |  $25,000
Total Budget             | $250,000

The maintenance work item is similar to a work item from round one. We've been
able to spend the maintenance budget paying 4-5 experienced pandas maintainers
for their time. Additionally, pandas now has a team of (volunteer) triagers. We
can identify active members from this team who would be able to do more if they
had funding.

We do not currently have any specific individuals lined up to do the work on
nullable types. That said, we have a handful of contributors who are capable of
doing the work, especially if they can be compensated for the work.

We'd like to emphasize that pandas is extremely flexible with respect to the
amount of funding. The maintenance work in particular is essentially unending.
An FTE focused solely on pandas could probably keep up with the stream of
updates to the project, but paying down the debt we've accumulated in the
backlog of issues will take even more time. To that end, we're happy to work
with the foundation to get a budget that works for everyone. Any amount of
funding for maintenance helps.
